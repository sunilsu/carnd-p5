**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector.
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook (or in lines # through # of the file called `some_file.py`).  

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=9`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

I tried various combinations of colorspaces and HOG parameters and trained a linear SVM using the hog parameters from different channels. I tried HSV, YUV and YCrCb and settled on YCrCb based on results on test set. `orientations=9`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)` performed well and I kept these parameters.

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

 This is under the **Classifier** section of the notebook. I trained a linear SVM, using LinearSVC from the scikit-learn package, taking all channels of images converted to YCrCb colorspace. Feature set included spatial features, color features and all three YCrCb channels. The  feature vector has a length of 6108. For spatial binning, I used patches of spatial_size=(16,16). Color histograms were implemented using hist_bins=16. After training, I got a test accuracy of 98.8%. Some false positives include side rails, lane markers and some shadows on the lanes.

### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

I implemented the efficient sliding window search where I can extract hog features once and then sub-sample to get all of its overlaying windows. Each window is defined by a scaling factor where a scale of 1 would result in a window that's 8 x 8 cells then the overlap of each window is in terms of the cell distance. This means that a cells_per_step = 2 would result in a search window overlap of 75%.

I tried 3 scales at different y-positions. `scales = [1.5, 1.25, 1.0]`
`y_start_stops = [(500,680),(400, 600),(380,460)]`, `colors = [blue, green, red]`

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

I searched on 3 scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_out.mp4)


#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  The threshold was atleast 15 from a set of 30 consecutive frames. I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:

### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

I chose the window scale to decrease with distance from the car in the Y direction. The scale doesn't decrease linearly for all X and this is something I will change to make it more robust.
Also, the bounding boxes are not tight, since the entire window is considered hot when there is a detection. We are not predicting box overlaps and this is a limitation. Some deep learning based object detection predict the bounding box coordinates along with detection and they do a better job at predicting tighter boxes.
